At the next [OWASP Ruhrpott](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_German_Chapter_Stammtisch_Initiative/Ruhrpott) meeting I will present the current state of the web application firewall [Shadow Daemon](https://shadowd.zecure.org). The main topics of my talk will be the architecture and attack detection of the system, but you can also expect comparisons with other free web application firewalls like *mod_security* and *naxsi*.

<!--more-->

After the talk I will demonstrate the installation and configuration of *Shadow Daemon* from scratch. I will also use the example installation to show the protection at work by attacking it. You are invited to try it out on your own system in a virtual machine and you will see that the installation is easy and brings many advantages.

The talk will be given in German. If you are interested, this is the date and location:

    04/28/2015 - 07:00 pm

    Unperfekthaus
    Friedrich-Ebert-Str. 18
    45127 Essen
